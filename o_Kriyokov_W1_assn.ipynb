    "As a big fan of red wine, I found this data very interesting, learning about different wine factors that can predict the quality of wine and their meaning. I think this data will be well used in regression and classification. For example, which factors has influence on the wine quality, which factors make the wine a good wine. Are there any relationships between the different variables?\n",
